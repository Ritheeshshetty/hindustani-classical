              <h3>Hindustani Classical Music:</h3>
              Flourishing in North India, Hindustani music boasts a rich history
              influenced by both Hindu and Islamic traditions. This music
              emphasizes improvisation, with artists weaving their own creative
              explorations within the framework of ragas (melodic structures).
              String instruments like the sitar and sarod take center stage,
              accompanied by the rhythmic pulse of the tabla. The overall feel
              can be uplifting, introspective, or deeply emotional, depending on
              the chosen raga.
            </p>
            <p className="int_theory">
              <h3>Carnatic Classical Music:</h3>
              Originating in South India, Carnatic music is known for its
              structured compositions and adherence to mathematical principles.
              While improvisation exists, it plays a less prominent role
              compared to Hindustani music. Carnatic music features a strong
              focus on vocals, often accompanied by instruments like the veena
              (a string instrument) and the mridangam (a drum). Thematic
              elements often center around devotional themes and spiritual
              expression.
            </p>
            <p className="int_theory">
              <h3>Key Differences:</h3>
              Improvisation vs. Composition: Hindustani prioritizes
              improvisation, while Carnatic leans towards pre-composed pieces.
              Instruments: Hindustani leans towards string instruments, Carnatic
              towards vocals and specific instruments like the veena and
              mridangam. Structure: Hindustani allows for more freedom within
              the raga, Carnatic follows a more defined structure in
              compositions. Focus: Hindustani explores a wider range of
              emotions, Carnatic often focuses on devotional themes.

          <h1>A bit more about Hindustani Classical Music:</h1>
          <h4>
            Hindustani classical music, a captivating art form from North India,
            boasts a rich tradition based on intricate melodic structures and
            captivating improvisations. Let's delve into the foundational
            elements:
          </h4>
          <p>
            Swaras: The building blocks of melody, similar to notes in Western
            music. There are seven main swaras (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni)
            that roughly correspond to the solfege system (Do, Re, Mi...).
            However, swaras encompass more than just pitch; they embody subtle
            variations in tone and emotional expression. <br />
            Ragas: The heart and soul of Hindustani music. Ragas are melodic
            frameworks that define a specific sequence of notes (aroh -
            ascending, avaroh - descending) and characteristic phrases. Each
            raga evokes a unique mood or sentiment. <br />
            Talas: The rhythmic foundation of Hindustani music. Talas define
            rhythmic cycles with specific beats and subdivisions (matras). The
            tabla, a versatile drum set, is a key instrument in keeping the
            tala. <br />
            Improvisation (alap, taan): A defining characteristic of Hindustani
            music. Artists explore the raga through extended, unmetered sections
            (alap) and virtuosic, rhythmic elaborations (taan). This allows for
            unique interpretations and expressions within the raga framework.{" "}
            <br />
            Gharanas: Traditional schools of Hindustani music that have passed
            down knowledge and style through generations. Each gharana
            emphasizes specific interpretations of ragas and unique playing
            techniques for instruments. This is just a glimpse into the
            captivating world of Hindustani music. As you explore further, these
            technical terms will become the keys to unlocking a deeper
            appreciation for this rich and vibrant art form.

          <h1>What are Swaras?</h1>
          <h3>
            The Basics: Swaras are the fundamental units of melody in Indian
            classical music (both Hindustani and Carnatic).

          <ol>
            <h4>Seven Main Swaras: There are seven main swaras:</h4>

            <li>Re (Rishabh)</li>

            <li>Dha (Dhaivat)</li>
            <li>Ni (Nishad)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Equivalents: These roughly correspond to the Western "Do, Re, Mi..."
            (solfege) system. More than Notes: Swaras aren't just about pitch;
            they also encompass subtle variations in tone, ornamentation, and
            the emotional quality a musician brings to them.

          <h1>What is a raga?</h1>
          <h4>
            A raga in Indian classical music is a melodic framework that serves
            as the foundation for improvisation and composition. Here's a
            breakdown of its key elements:
          </h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A Scale with Personality: A raga uses a specific set of notes
              (swaras) in both ascending (aaroh) and descending (avaroh) order.
              This is its basic scale, but a raga is much more than just a set
              of notes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prescribed Melodies: Each raga has characteristic melodic phrases
              and motifs that give it a unique identity and emotional quality. A
              musician must understand how to move through the raga, emphasizing
              certain notes and using these phrases to create a sense of the
              raga's character.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mood & Time: Many ragas are associated with specific moods (joy,
              peace, sorrow) or even times of day. They can evoke a strong sense
              of atmosphere through their melodic structures.
            </li>
            <li>
              Space for Artistry: Within the boundaries of the raga, there is
              immense freedom for a musician to explore and improvise. This is
              where a skilled artist puts their own stamp on the performance,
              creating unique and moving renditions of a raga.
            </li>
            <li>
              Think of a raga as a painter's palette: it provides the essential
              colors (notes), some guidelines for composition (phrases), and a
              suggested mood, but ultimately, it's up to the painter (musician)
              to use it creatively.
